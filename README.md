# Setup Requirements

## Message Infrastructure
Setup a RabbitMQ instance and set the URL from the RabbitMQ instance to *visp.infrastructurehost*  *spring.rabbitmq.host* in application.properties.
Further create a user with the name *visp* and the password *visp*.

## Data Backend
Setup a Mysql database with username: *root*, password: *password* and a database: *visp* on the same machine as the VISP runtime

## Configure the Dockerhost image
Set the id of an CoreOS image on an Openstack instance for the parameter *visp.dockerhost.image* in application.properties

## Access Configuration
Create a copy of the *credential.sample.properties* and store it as *credential.properties* and add the access credentials to this file.

# Start VISP runtime

The application can be started with:

```
mvn spring-boot:run

```

At startup, the VISP runtime creates the topology based on the configured topology (*visp.topology* in *application.propertie*s), starts an initial Dockerhost for the services and created the initial processing configuration (one instance for each service).

# Configuring the Runtime

## Topology selection
The topology can be choosen based on the value of *visp.topology*  in *application.properties*.

## BTU configuration of Hosts
The billing time unit of the Hosts can be configured based on the value of *visp.btu* in *application.properties*.

## Graceperiod for shutdown
The graceperiod for shutting down processing services can be set based on the value of *visp.shutdown.graceperiod* in *application.properties*.

## Simulation
The property *visp.simulation* in *application.properties* allows the runtime to simulate the scheduling behavior without spawning hosts
